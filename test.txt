Nocturnal Flight Call, flight call

This call came from a bird in flight (as you can see from sonograms). It doesn't convince me as a Robin (i think it hasn't these such a kind of flight calls in its reportoire). My thought goes on Little bunting (Emberiza pusilla). Someone could confirm my impression?
